---

## 🗄️ Phase 1 — Database Design & Setup

### 1.1 Choose & Provision Database
- [x] Install PostgreSQL locally (or spin up via `docker-compose`)
- [x] Install the **PostGIS** extension: `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`
- [x] Confirm connection works with a test query

### 1.2 Design the Schema — Core Tables

#### `users` table
- [x] Define fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` (ENUM: `coordinator`, `volunteer`, `field_worker`), `created_at`
- [x] Add unique constraint on `email`

#### `volunteers` table (extends users)
- [x] Define fields: `user_id` (FK), `skills` (TEXT[] array: e.g., `['medical', 'logistics', 'counseling']`), `location` (PostGIS `POINT`), `is_available` (BOOLEAN), `tasks_completed` (INT), `completion_rate` (FLOAT)
- [x] Add spatial index: `CREATE INDEX ON volunteers USING GIST(location);`

#### `needs` table
- [x] Define fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `need_type` (ENUM: `medical`, `food`, `shelter`, `education`, `other`), `location` (PostGIS `POINT`), `ward`, `district`, `people_affected` (INT), `urgency_score` (FLOAT 1–10), `status` (ENUM: `open`, `assigned`, `in_progress`, `completed`), `is_disaster_zone` (BOOLEAN), `reported_by` (FK → users), `created_at`, `updated_at`
- [x] Add spatial index on `location`

#### `tasks` table
- [x] Define fields: `id`, `need_id` (FK), `assigned_volunteer_id` (FK → users), `assigned_at`, `checked_in_at`, `completed_at`, `status` (mirrors need status), `notes`

#### `organizations` table
- [x] Define fields: `id`, `name`, `contact_email`, `district`, `created_at`
- [x] Link `users` to `organizations` via `org_id` FK

### 1.3 Write Migrations

- [ ] Run all migrations and verify tables exist: `\dt` in psql

### 1.4 Seed Data
- [x] Create a seed script with at least:
  - 1 coordinator account
  - 10 volunteer accounts with varied skills and geo-locations around a sample city (e.g., Kolkata)
  - 15–20 sample `needs` records across different wards with varied urgency levels
  - 5 tasks in various statuses
- [ ] Run seed and verify data in DB


---

## 🔧 Phase 2 — Backend API Development

### 2.1 Project Bootstrap
- [x] Initialize project: `npm init` (Express) or `fastapi` scaffold (Python)
- [x] Install core dependencies:
  - Express: `express`, `pg`, `knex`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `cors`, `dotenv`
  - FastAPI: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg2`, `python-jose`, `passlib`
- [x] Set up a basic `health check` endpoint: `GET /api/health → { status: "ok" }`
- [x] Verify the server starts and the health check works

### 2.2 Authentication Module
- [x] Implement `POST /api/auth/register` — hash password, store user, return JWT
- [x] Implement `POST /api/auth/login` — verify credentials, return JWT + role
- [x] Create `authMiddleware` — validates JWT on protected routes
- [x] Test both endpoints with Postman or Thunder Client

### 2.3 Needs API
- [x] `POST /api/needs` — create a need (field worker / coordinator), trigger urgency scoring
- [x] `GET /api/needs` — list all needs (filterable by status, district, need_type, urgency)
- [x] `GET /api/needs/:id` — get single need with full details
- [x] `PATCH /api/needs/:id/status` — update status (coordinator only)
- [x] `GET /api/needs/heatmap` — return all needs with lat/lng + urgency_score for map rendering

### 2.4 Urgency Scoring Algorithm
> This is a core differentiator — implement it carefully.

- [x] Create a `scoringService.js` (or `scoring_service.py`) module
- [x] Implement base scoring formula:

```
urgency_score =
  (need_type_weight)           // medical=4, food=3, shelter=2, education=1
  + (people_affected / 50)     // capped at 3 points
  + (hours_since_reported / 6) // capped at 2 points
  + (is_disaster_zone ? 1 : 0) // bonus point
  → normalize to 1–10 scale
```

- [x] Add `disaster_mode` flag — if `true`, multiply urgency scores by 1.5 (capped at 10)
- [x] Call this service on every `POST /api/needs` and store the score
- [x] Write a cron job (or manual trigger) to **recalculate scores every hour** based on time elapsed
- [x] Write unit tests for the scoring function with edge cases

### 2.5 Volunteer Matching Algorithm
> This is the "Smart Dispatch" engine — your hackathon showpiece.

- [x] Create `matchingService.js` (or `matching_service.py`)
- [x] For a given `need_id`, implement composite scoring per volunteer:

```
match_score =
  (1 / geo_distance_km) * 40     // proximity weight: 40%
  + (skill_overlap_count) * 30   // skill match weight: 30%
  + (is_available ? 1 : 0) * 20  // availability weight: 20%
  + (completion_rate) * 10       // reliability weight: 10%
```

- [x] Use PostGIS `ST_Distance` for geo-distance queries:
  ```sql
  SELECT *, ST_Distance(location::geography, ST_MakePoint($lon, $lat)::geography) AS dist_m
  FROM volunteers WHERE is_available = true ORDER BY dist_m ASC LIMIT 10;
  ```
- [x] Return top 3 matched volunteers with their scores and distances
- [x] Implement `GET /api/needs/:id/matches` — returns ranked volunteer list

### 2.6 Tasks API
- [x] `POST /api/tasks` — assign a volunteer to a need (coordinator only), set status to `assigned`
- [x] `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/checkin` — volunteer GPS check-in, updates `checked_in_at` and status to `in_progress`
- [x] `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` — volunteer marks task done, updates `completed_at`, increments `tasks_completed` on volunteer, recalculates `completion_rate`
- [x] `GET /api/tasks/my` — volunteer sees their own task list

### 2.7 Volunteers API
- [x] `GET /api/volunteers` — list all volunteers (coordinator view)
- [x] `PATCH /api/volunteers/me/availability` — toggle volunteer availability on/off
- [x] `PATCH /api/volunteers/me/location` — update volunteer's current GPS location
- [x] `GET /api/volunteers/me/stats` — return `tasks_completed`, `completion_rate`, active tasks

### 2.8 API Testing & Documentation
- [x] Test every endpoint with mock data
- [x] Write a simple `API.md` documenting all routes, request bodies, and response shapes
- [x] Add basic rate limiting middleware (optional but good for demo)

## 🎨 Phase 3 — Frontend Development

### 3.1 Project Bootstrap
- [ ] Scaffold with Vite: `npm create vite@latest client -- --template react`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `tailwindcss`, `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `leaflet`, `react-leaflet`, `lucide-react`
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS: `tailwind.config.js` + `@tailwind` directives in `index.css`
- [ ] Create folder structure:
  ```
  /src
    /components   → reusable UI pieces
    /pages        → route-level views
    /hooks        → custom React hooks
    /services     → axios API calls
    /context      → auth context
  ```
- [ ] Set up `react-router-dom` with routes for `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/volunteer`, `/field`
- [ ] Create `AuthContext` with login/logout/currentUser state

### 3.2 Auth Pages
- [ ] Build `LoginPage.jsx` — email + password form, role-based redirect on success
- [ ] Build `RegisterPage.jsx` — name, email, password, role selector, skills multi-select (for volunteers)
- [ ] Implement `ProtectedRoute` component — redirects to login if no JWT in localStorage
- [ ] Test login flow end-to-end with real backend

### 3.3 Field Worker Form (View 1)
> Ultra-simple. Low-bandwidth. Mobile-first.

- [ ] Build `FieldForm.jsx` page — full-screen, single-column form
- [ ] Add fields: Title, Description, Need Type (dropdown), Ward, District, People Affected, GPS auto-fill button
- [ ] Add GPS capture: `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` → populates hidden lat/lng fields
- [ ] Implement **offline support with Service Worker**:
  - [ ] Create `public/sw.js` — cache form page and assets
  - [ ] Implement `IndexedDB` queue — if offline, store submission locally
  - [ ] On network restore, flush the queue and sync to backend
- [ ] Add a visual "Offline / Online" indicator badge
- [ ] Show urgency score preview (calculate client-side before submission)
- [ ] Test on a mobile browser (Chrome DevTools device mode)

### 3.4 NGO Coordinator Dashboard (View 2)
> This is your hero view. Make it impressive.

#### 3.4.1 Layout & Shell
- [ ] Build `DashboardPage.jsx` with a two-panel layout: left sidebar (stats + filters) + right main area (map + list)
- [ ] Add top nav: SevaSetu logo, coordinator name, logout
- [ ] Add summary cards row: Total Open Needs | Active Volunteers | Tasks In Progress | Completed Today

#### 3.4.2 Needs Heatmap
- [ ] Integrate `react-leaflet` with OpenStreetMap tiles (no API key needed)
- [ ] Plot each need as a circle marker — color-coded by urgency: 🔴 8–10, 🟠 5–7, 🟢 1–4
- [ ] Make markers clickable — popup shows: need title, urgency score, people affected, status, "Dispatch" button
- [ ] Add a legend component showing urgency color scale
- [ ] Center the map on the district with the most open needs

#### 3.4.3 Needs List Panel
- [ ] Build `NeedsList.jsx` — sortable table/card list below or beside the map
- [ ] Columns: Ward, Need Type, Urgency Score (badge), People Affected, Status (pill), Time Since Reported, Actions
- [ ] Add filter controls: by Status, by Need Type, by District
- [ ] Clicking a row highlights the corresponding map marker

#### 3.4.4 Volunteer Dispatch Flow
- [ ] When coordinator clicks "Dispatch" on a need, open a `MatchModal.jsx`
- [ ] `MatchModal` calls `GET /api/needs/:id/matches` and displays top 3 volunteers:
  - Volunteer name, skills (tag pills), distance from need, availability status, completion rate (%)
- [ ] "Assign" button on each volunteer card → calls `POST /api/tasks` → closes modal → updates need status to `assigned`
- [ ] Show a success toast notification on assignment

#### 3.4.5 Task Status Pipeline
- [ ] Build a `KanbanBoard.jsx` or pipeline view: Open → Assigned → In Progress → Completed
- [ ] Each task card shows: need title, assigned volunteer, time elapsed
- [ ] Allow drag-and-drop or button-based status updates (button approach is faster to build)

### 3.5 Volunteer App (View 3)
> Mobile-friendly web app — volunteers use this on their phones.

- [ ] Build `VolunteerPage.jsx` — mobile-first, card-based layout
- [ ] Show current availability toggle (ON/OFF switch) — calls `PATCH /api/volunteers/me/availability`
- [ ] Show assigned tasks list with status chips
- [ ] For each `assigned` task: show need details + a "Check In" button
  - [ ] "Check In" → capture current GPS → call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/checkin`
- [ ] For each `in_progress` task: show a "Mark Complete" button
  - [ ] "Mark Complete" → call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` → show celebration state
- [ ] Show **Impact Stats** card: Tasks Completed, Completion Rate, Distance Covered (optional)
- [ ] Implement background location update: every 5 minutes, if task is active, push new GPS coords

## ⚙️ Phase 4 — Integration & End-to-End Testing

### 4.1 Connect Frontend to Backend
- [ ] Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` pointing to local backend
- [ ] Confirm all API calls use the axios `baseURL` — no hardcoded URLs
- [ ] Test the full lifecycle: Field worker submits need → Coordinator sees it on map → Matches volunteers → Assigns → Volunteer checks in → Volunteer completes → Status updates everywhere

### 4.2 Auth Flow Testing
- [ ] Register a coordinator, a volunteer, and a field worker
- [ ] Verify role-based routing works (coordinator sees dashboard, volunteer sees volunteer app)
- [ ] Verify JWT expiry handling — redirect to login on expired token

### 4.3 Algorithm Validation
- [ ] Create 5 test needs with varied parameters
- [ ] Verify urgency scores are ranked in the expected order
- [ ] Create 10 test volunteers at varying distances and skills
- [ ] Verify the matching engine returns the correct top 3 for each need type

### 4.4 Offline Form Testing
- [ ] Open the field form in Chrome → go to DevTools → Network → set to Offline
- [ ] Submit a need → verify it queues in IndexedDB (Application tab in DevTools)
- [ ] Restore network → verify the queued submission syncs to backend
- [ ] Confirm the need appears on the coordinator dashboard
